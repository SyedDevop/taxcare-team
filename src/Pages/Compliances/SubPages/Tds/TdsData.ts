        mainParagraph: `TDS or Tax Deducted at Source is income tax reduced from the money paid at the time of making specified payments such as rent, commission, professional fees, salary, interest etc. by the persons making such payments. Usually, the person receiving income is liable to pay income tax. But the government with the help of Tax Deducted at Source provisions makes sure that income tax is deducted in advance from the payments being made by you. The recipient of income receives the net amount (after reducing TDS).`,
        sebParagraph: [
          `Any person making specified payments mentioned under the Income Tax Act are required to deduct TDS at the time of making such specified payment. But no TDS has to deducted if the person making the payment is an individual or HUF whose books are not required to be audited. However, in case of rent payments made by individuals and HUF exceeding Rs 50,000 per month, are required to deduct TDS @ 5% even if the individual or HUF is not liable for a tax audit. Also, such Individuals and HUF liable to deduct TDS @ 5% need not apply for TAN. `,
          `TDS deducted in the month of June must be paid to the government by 7th July. However, the TDS deducted in the month of March can be deposited till 30th April. For TDS deducted on rent and purchase of property, the due date is 30 days from the end of the month in which TDS is deducted.`,
