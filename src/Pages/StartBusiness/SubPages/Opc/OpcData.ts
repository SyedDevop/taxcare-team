Such companies are generally started when one founder/promoter wants to start a business in the name of a private limited company with limited liability. Entrepreneurs who are in the early stages of planning companies prefer to establish one person company in India instead of a sole proprietorship business.`,
        sebParagraph: [
          `OPC has several advantages that other types of companies don't. So, if you want to start up your own business, you don't have to worry about all the complex and tedious processes. If you are want to register an OPC, then Legal Workmate can help you with One Person Company Registration in India.`,
          `OPC is a separate legal entity different from its promoter and acts as a distinct judicial person. The one person company has its own assets and liabilities. Due to the distinct entity promoter in OPC, it is not personally liable to repay the debts of the company.`,
          `On the other hand, sole proprietorships and their proprietors are the same persons. So, the law allows the attachment and sale of the promoter's assets in case of non-fulfilment of the business' liabilities.`,
